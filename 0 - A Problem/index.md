# [#0 – A Problem](http://www.comfortwar.com/0-a-problem/)


Hi, I’d like to present an idea:

“If you, despite you best efforts, despite your frequent willingness to dedicate yourself entirely to self–discipline, are nevertheless stuck, depleted, frustrated and unsuccessful—then there is exactly one, recklessly defiant way in which you should go about it; a Comfort War.”

 

 

What I’ve just described are unique conditions; your unique conditions. Because they are specific, I can make a few axiomatic assumptions and then extrapolate to their logical conclusion. So, in the next hour I’ll build such a case, beginning with the familiar and expanding into the unforeseen, and this will be the jist of it: You’ve been consumed by your own passion. You don’t lack motivation, no, you have it in abundance. So much so, that you’ve become overwhelmed by it and suppressed it with layers upon layers of comfort, allowing it, inadvertently, to swallow you whole. Your desire is so fervent, so overbearing, that by leaving such a beast unattended, it wreaks havoc, devouring every shred of stimuli it can get its hands on just to satiate its need. This creates a deep incongruence within you, and it is why you’re frustrated; because you are not you—you’re not the way you should be. What you may feel is a total, unavailing, miserable need for cheap gratification is only a reaction, in fact, of a nullified, equally ravenous and fervent desire for real fulfillment—one that might put even the Greats to shame. Think of Joe Louis, Sonny Liston or Aaron Pryor, for example, who reigned as tremendous world boxing champions but later, after retirement, turned to drugs and alcohol to fulfil their need; you’ve been consumed by your own passion.

This being the case, you only have one logical alternative to your current circumstance—to become obsessed; to center your entire life around meaningful pursuit. Yet incidentally, seeing as you don’t have any “middle-ground” or a “balanced” option available to you, the challenges ahead are far different for you than for those combating hardship. You, my friend, are at war with comfort. And that, is a fact far more insidious than you may imagine.

 

Now, there’s a lot to get into here, but seeing how this is the very first podcast, I’ll briefly cover the basic premise of these installments. Most important, is that in light of the outstanding amount of misinformation that’s currently out there, you understand what makes this podcast different, and worth your time. So know this:

1st. The most crucial, need to know, step-by-step information is available to you now in the Comfort War book which can be downloaded directly from the site comfortwar.com. The podcast, in essence, is only to sustain you in the efforts already detailed there.

2nd. This podcast is about a few things, but primarily it’s about perspective and ideas. In each of these I’ll present a rational, well-researched idea, along with a transcript and citations for you to scrutinize. I’ll do so by keeping my incentives honest in the most anti-Machiavellian means possible, providing free access in return for support only if you found the information valuable thereafter, and all proceeds go to further this effort.

These two are the rules of this podcast, allowing it to survive and thrive only through the use of reason and by providing value. You may find that in your life, perspective—the very way in which you see—is currently inseparable from your experiences. And with these ideas, that is what I intend to disrupt; the very way in which you see. By allowing you to regularly introduce yourself to a mindset so far outside your own, this external intervention, should you seek it, enables even your self-perception to undergo drastic change.

 

 

So, back to business. Let’s get right into it, shall we? And where better than by describing the enemy?

In today’s self-help, we try and focus our efforts on how to get rich, healthy, win friends, influence people et cetera, but all of these are just symptoms, they don’t address the problem at its core. It’s akin to trying and fix a broken engine by repairing the pistons and cylinders, but not once changing your oil. When you don’t know the oil needs changing, every time your engine breaks it seems like an engine problem, not an oil one. Similarly, our own “self-help” problem has a yet unattended and illusory root-cause:

See, back in 1973[1] Nobel laureate Nikolaas Tinbergen coined the term “supernormal stimuli” to describe an artificially exaggerated version of a naturally-occurring stimulus. As it seems, outside of nature’s de facto threshold for stimuli, there is no such thing as a “sweet spot”; a brain reacting to certain environmental triggers does so uninhibitedly—more stimuli means more reaction. So when the male Giant Jewel Beetle responds to the exaggerated occurrence of his accustomed mating cues present in the size, color, curvature and shiny-“jewely” appearance of brown beer bottles, he ignores his female counterpart and tries vehemently to get busy with these stubbies[2]. Male stickleback fish get aggressive in face of wooden replicas with underbellies painted red, songbird parents ignore their offspring in face of better-decorated fakes[3], moths kamikaze into burning flames thinking they’re navigating by moonlight, and so on. The list of life affected by supernormal stimuli is without end; including us in it.

Your brain, evolved for the environment of 40,000 BC[4], responding to what it thinks are naturally-occurring stimuli, is similarly hijacked.

foods saturated in fats, sugars and salts;

an endless stream of sexual encounters at a click;

instant and cheap affirmation on social media;

adventures, risk-taking and achievement in video games;

unlimited novelty and content on aggregator websites;

fast-paced-high-pitched-pure-toned musical rhythms;

medicated fixups that can help you think/sleep/hype–up/calm–down/grow muscle/lose weight/kill–pain/get hard/get high,

The feedback caused by supernormal stimuli creates positive emotion in response to behavior that is, in fact, detrimental; same as if you snorted cocaine causing your mind to reaffirm your incredible “success”, it will think a $1 cheeseburger is healthy and nutritious, or that consuming pornography increases your chances of reproduction. Unbeknownst to your brain, we’ve experienced in the past few decades a hyper-leap in the conditions of our surrounding environment, and it hasn’t caught up (nor will it). Moreover, it is definitively unprepared to deal with the total and unrestrained immersion of supernormal stimuli in our lives that we experience during our formative years.

This is because our brain arrangements itself and its connections most—it is most plastic—during our early years and into adolescence[5]; if developed under conditions of supernormal stimuli, it automates its processes under these conditions of faulty reward. So imagine, the latest generations of mankind, unprecedently born and raised into this, how could we think for a second that this will not have considerable consequences?! But we’re getting ahead of ourselves, more on that later.

Many cognitive neuroscientists argue[6] that only 5% of our cognitive activities (decisions, emotions, actions, behaviors et cetera) are conscious whereas the remainder is generated in a non-conscious manner. In such a fashion, we are overwhelmingly managed by our subconscious.

Makes sense, doesn’t it? Imagine having to actively instruct your heart to pump, or your lungs to draw breath; that would be absurd. Instead, this mechanism allows us to essentially “program” the way in which we operate on a day-to-day basis, based on what we’ve done and experienced in the past—resulting in these repetitious actions becoming automated. Most notably, this “automating” isn’t just limited to your physiology, it also includes the ways in which your thoughts function as you engage in routines which you’ve been accustomed to—your behavioral habits.

In other words,

arguably 95% of our “programming”, thinking and intuition power forward on a habitual course, whilst our meager conscious minds stand alone to oppose them. For a heroically miniscule portion of your experience, you’ll perhaps be able to make some real decisions and resolve to change these poor habits through sheer willpower—but during the rest? Not a chance; you’ve tried that.

The nature of this struggle, is that it is nearly impossible to adapt at-once the total composure necessary to face a hardwired, reoccurring inclination toward comfort-seeking; as you resolve to change, your intent is regularly superseded by your neurological underpinnings seeking to maintain the status-quo.

But as I’ve said, we don’t focus on that. We focus on the symptoms instead, desperately failing at our attempts to correct them; too often inclined to underestimate the effort before us.

To succeed, this struggle must be framed differently.

See, the definitive, most pathological aspect of this state is the way in which, despite your great need, a pervasive incomprehension will deny you the ability to just “look it up”. Call it brain fog, clouding of consciousness, moha, call it anything you like; this cognitive impairment has always been there, and was therefore (by definition) nearly impossible to address.

This in and of itself, is the crux of a Comfort War; the lack of clarity.

I’d argue that clarity is the opposite of comfort—the perfect weapon in your arsenal. Relentless pursuit of clarity, is the relentless pursuit of a stable foundation upon which you can build your discipline. Without it, your efforts are a house of cards, your motivation a fleeting interest and all there to support a whim that has yet been dissuaded from taking a tumble.

This simple piece, pursuing clarity, is nearly always overlooked in conventional stories of success, as the concept of clear-thinking isn’t easily recalled of a struggle by those who’ve already attained it. Our role models will remember the hardship, moments of despair, the “just do it” mentality, but not the (seemingly trivial) fact that they were able to focus in and see things for what they really were.

Knowing this, your challenge is to regain composure; to get the information that is relevant to your reaching of a stable starting point. As with any worthwhile endeavor, it will not be effortless.

Should you attain it, you’ll suddenly find all the advice you’ve heard thus far to be sharply applicable. Your efforts then can be justly fought for once more, supported by a vivid coherence, in the simple matter that is rising up to live life in all the glory and beauty it has to offer. Such clarity, is the rarest currency in our day-and-age, for sight cannot be easily attained by seeking.

 

Academically, this struggle is viewed under the following terms: The pursuit of comfort, is often an attempt to use the (more common) method of thought suppression to completely drown out negative emotional impulses instead of using the (more effective) method of cognitive reappraisal to change the way we think and address a potentially emotion-eliciting event (‘‘I control my emotions by not thinking of them’’ versus “I control my emotions by changing the way I think about the situation I’m in’’). Instead of overcoming our fears, anxieties, urges, stressors—even boredom—instead of molding them, harnessing them, we push them out of our minds and encourage them to lie dormant. And, not only has the repeated use of suppression over reappraisal been often associated with a higher frequency such emotions[7] and obsessive-compulsive disorder[8], it has been further shown that such maladaptive attempts at inhibiting negative emotional impulses are a process that eventually becomes unconscious and automated over time[9].

In other words, in an attempt to feel better–you’ll feel worse, more often, with potential for very hazardous consequences that will only become harder to avoid with time.

The solution to all of this, is finding a way to extract yourself on a daily basis out of this mindless haze that permeates below your level of awareness; to “reset” daily. Resolve to fight, daily. As it stands, subconscious comfort-seeking is certain to engulf your thinking at one point or another each and every day—the difference this time, however, will be that through understanding the mechanism that causes it, you’ll be able to regularly obstruct this cycle. By employing a reset, your clarity can (and will) inch forward, making real progress, and incrementally stacking the odds in your favor—eventually, completely overtaking comfortable mindlessness.

 

I call these “Manual Resets” (MRs), and they are the corner-stone method of the Comfort War. In the pursuit of clarity, you confront your frustrations; you leverage your desperation. Set a time, or times, each day that must qualify under the following three criteria:

    Conducted in private.
    Involves difficulty.
    And
    Sensory input is minimized throughout.

How you do this is at your own discretion, and again—you’ll find details in the book. But there is one more single and important caveat: the MR must become your absolute determiner of daily success and failure. You want the secret to fundamental change? Don’t allow yourself to forget that you want it. In the dire depths of subconscious mindlessness, shackle yourself to a conspectus.

Prioritizing the pursuit of clarity is simply a form of pursuing mental health; an effort to get your head “unfucked”, if you will. And getting your head unfucked, simply isn’t a non-radical, consistent process. Bended metal, is not straightened by retaining it in normal position, it must be leveraged in the opposite direction, until it eventually corrects the crook and returns to an unbent form.

That is the Comfort War effort, and it relies on a simple and consistent reminder. This reminder, every day, determines your success or failure, and if for that reason alone—it is a measure that is exclusive to the desperate.

In the words of Nietzsche, the 19th century German philosopher: “The human being who does not wish to belong to the mass must merely cease being comfortable with himself; let him follow his conscience which shouts at him: ‘Be yourself! What you are at present doing, opining, and desiring, that is not really you.”[10]

Remember, you don’t lack motivation. It is burning and smoldering within you, but you’ve trapped it, suppressed it with layers of comfort that smother it all but for its ever-reoccurring lapses of anxiety and discontent. Leave it ungratified by cheap stimuli, allow it to swelter and boil. Discover your frustrations, discover yourself, discover your conscience roaring and clamoring at you. Use that to your advantage, focus only on the antithesis of comfort’s suppressive hindrance—progressively gaining clarity—no longer needing to attain your spirit, only unleash it.

 

 

 

That is the first lesson, but we’re not quite done. As I mentioned I would in the beginning, let’s take this idea to its logical conclusion.

As we introduced supernormal stimuli into our culture, as we’ve grown dependent on it, it seems to me that as a species, we’ve undergone a fundamental change; it seems to me, that despite it still being widely unknown—if every generation can be defined by a single challenge, this is ours.

There’s no arguing that supernormal stimuli’s presence is now pervasive in our culture; we get our babies hooked on iPads and never do they outgrow it. But it’s more than that: cheap and widespread as it is, our youth is saturated and most influenced by a supernormal environment during the years of their life in which they are least self-defined, most prone to inhibition, and completely lacking autonomy. During the time in which their brain forms the vast majority of its cognitive connections, as it is most corrupted by these prefabricated influences, they lack choice—and somehow, it always comes down to choice.

This incremental impairment, not only of the quality of our thinking, but of our very tendencies, our intuitions, our perspective, coincides—interestingly—with another recent trend in our society; you may have noticed.

Today, it seems that whenever society is inflicted by some issue whereupon knowledge on the topic is easily-attainable and freely-available—that doesn’t stop a considerable number of people from responding irrationally, irresponsibly and in an uneducated manner; somehow, individual action always comes down to choice.

Without a doubt, the astounding availability of information in our day-and-age has had a tremendous and overwhelmingly-positive impact on our society. Transparency and access to information are corner stones in any free society—yet still, somehow, whenever it is time to act, it always comes down to choice.

You can bombard individuals with data-packed PSA’s, get millions of social media “likes” and signatures on your petitions, “raising awareness” and “educating the public” sort-of-speak, and yet many will still elect to behave foolishly. It always. comes down. to choice.

Even in trivial matters, even when we can expect the vast majority of the crowd to act well, there are always some who do not willfully choose, and do act even in their own self-interest—so a fortiori, up against supernormal stimuli, in its lack of congruence, in its effects so deceptive in nature, so thoughtlessly-appealing, do we expect such a challenge to be overcome by any but for a select few, able to undo its detrimental inclinations with choice?

Though all are capable of overcoming it, certainly, it is an effort too counter-intuitive—as one must forego all that they’ve relied on in the past, desperately, pursuing clarity with all their might. It is going to come down to this choice.

And yet, we are not a culture that forms itself by the guidance of a rational minority. No, our democracies are differently engineered, whereupon the mass is most often steered toward simple, unvirtuous frivolities. It is easy to see the overwhelming tendency in modern-day public agenda to neglect the imperative of personal-responsibility, accounting instead for gross negligence—protecting the majority from itself.

To get to my point, I don’t intend here to go much further in depth into the flaws of democracy or the folly of crowds. I will assume that we all know well, how irrational the mob can become and how easily swayed. But I do wish to highlight, what is perhaps, a more subtle feature—one that is especially consequential as society’s challenges shift from those of hardship to those of comfort:

In democracy, standing apart from the crowd, one still bears its burdens. Within the mob’s madness, one is forcibly swept up by their whims, and to this, there is only one exception: to take advantage of it. In a stand-alone environment you can choose, if you’re morally inclined, to add value to society—to act well, and even prosper in return. Yet, so long as the fruits of your labor are inseparable from the careless pickings of others, so long as any cause you may initiate will result in an effect gravely influenced by the mass’s zealous willingness to succumb to irrationality—you are only able, by playing on that irrationality. Dog-eats-dog, natural rights are just good PR—that is the mentality you can expect at the very top. One does not need to asses it long before determining that in its constant pursuit of frivolous distraction, in its weighting of trivialities, in its inclination toward inadequacy and self-detriment; the crowd, in general, demands its own undoing. Our heroes, able to conquer themselves through individual choice and overcome their comfortable inclinations with reason and discipline, eventually turn to villains, in face of a crowd unwilling to do so themselves. Make no mistake, this is not a bug; it’s a feature. And it matters now more than ever before. It matters most, when only willful choice paves the road to a good consequences and a good outcome.

Yet what is so wrong with this flaw, you might ask? So what? Democracies are unequal, politician cater to ignorance, so what? We make some progress, do we not? And does this relate at all to the Comfort War? We experience hardships and overcome them, learn from the mistakes of history—albeit slowly—and eventually rise to the challenge. And some, we’ll have you know, stay moral. Even if the crowd will go so far as to turn on them, they will work to help it prosper.

Perhaps.

Let’s take a look at the big picture and examine this.

Let’s remember, it is even true that for eons, as a species, we’ve always had a remedy for a circumstance such as this one; natural-selection rewarded positive qualities and reprimanded negative ones. But of course, in our modern-day world, random genetic mutations hardly play such a role; even the greatest super-gene, a resistance to Ebola perchance, is not nearly as likely to contribute to your survival as good health-care will, or contribute to the number of offspring that inherit your traits as a lack of access to birth-control or a poor socio-economic background undoubtedly will.

No, we’ve transitioned forward since then, incrementally shaping societies that propel us onward through competition, co-operation, pursuing ease and prosperity in the face of tremendous hardship.

We did so, of course, still supported by our animalistic urges—indeed honed by hereditary selection—to avoid pain, pursue pleasure and conserve energy. The cognitive revolution of Sapiens 70,000 years ago[11] had precisely this sort of impact; mind and beast working together—leveraging cultural traditions and myths, concepts of sacrifice and morality, fictitious intangible ideas such as monetary value, statehood and so on. In the still existent crucible of unavoidable hardship, these two pillars of humanity worked in unison, complementing each-other and resulting in great progress.

But ask yourself, what occurs when the interaction of these two becomes incongruent? What of when, the once pervasive “uncontrollable and terrible forces of nature” such as war, famine and plague come very-much under our control? What will become of a society in which Supernormal Stimuli—that which drives the human animal toward detriment, and eclipses his cognitive abilities—is cheaply available and on a mass-scale? In 2010, roughly 3,000,000 people died from obesity and related diseases while “only” 1,000,000 died that year from starvation and malnutrition. More people die today from old age than from infectious diseases, and you are more likely to commit suicide, than to die as victim of war, crime or terror combined[12]. And this is all tremendous, don’t get me wrong, but that does not, in any way, change the prudence demanded by the question; What of when hardship—the historical instigator of our resilient potential to rise and overcome—is negated in its effect?

In our day-and-age, do we reward good behavior and correct it when flawed? In a time where we are so confidently willing to assume humanity is a genus destined for exponential growth and will forever continue to advance forward without a struggle, do we not recognize that it is no longer supported by the primary selecting factors that have so contributed to it thus far? It is, in fact, impaired by them.

This time it’s different. This time, there is no reason to assume that the vast majority of humankind will eventually learn to overcome this challenge. We are not dealing with hardship, we are not dealing with matters of difficulty, folks. There is no room for oppression and revolt. There is no room for the animalistic mind to learn from its pains and endeavor toward a better future. This time, individuality and individuals are critical, willful and rational choice are critical, actions as they relate to their own consequences are critical—that is what we find at the epicenter of this defining effort.

It is no longer the case that good behavior is relatively the same behavior to which our monkey-brains are inclined. In fact, brains sensitive to stimuli—a once tremendously positive evolutionarily trait—have long been implicated in causing addiction[13][14] and many forms of psycho-pathology[15][16][17]. It is no longer the case that we can reliably expect the crowd do be on the right side of choice in the in the face of such a conflict, demanding and calling for reason, responsibility and clarity of mind.

In this endeavor so fundamentally based on choice and individual pursuit, on the resolve to meet action with consequence, we can only reasonably expect such a design to grandiosely fail. We must ask ourselves, so long as we are still morally inclined, can we transform society to a form of voluntary-participation? Can we restructure it to an extent where all will bear only the consequences of their own actions?

As I understand it, this is the only exception to this line-of-thought, available only to those who truly wish to seek strength for the great good—to add value. You can only say, within a system engineered to sustain and build upon these results, that morality must be pursued toward a fundamentally different design.

What we are presented with, therefore, I believe to be the greatest, most-defining challenge our generation will ever face. The onus to allow individuals to separate themselves from the public, to bear the effects of their own causes, rewarding good behavior and reprimanding it when faulty; a cultural-selection. No matter the circumstance, there will always be those who make bad choices, and for the first time, it is the vast majority. Even now, as the individuals able and willing are all the fewer and all the more crucial to this effort, our social structures incline them to become our enemies—promoting the conformity disease. Allowing people to participate amongst themselves voluntarily, not forced into the decisions of the crowds—allowing them to carry their consequences of their own actions—is the obvious answer.

Within a context of voluntary association, one does not even need to define what is inherently “good” or inherently “bad” in terms of behavior—only to participate with others in a way which they all find agreeable and judge the results for his/herself. It will not be long before cause, linked to its effect, becomes apparent.

You can see, therefore, the grand role of the Comfort Warrior in his/her simple and resolute choice to pursue clarity. First, he/she overcomes themselves; eventually, associating with others, overcoming life itself.

Consciousness is the greatest, most definitively impactful achievement in the history of our species, and in our time we carry the responsibility to let it flourish.

 

Now, some of you may find this challenge—your challenge—disheartening. You may even consider the concoction of your current circumstances a tragedy, and perhaps it is. As it so happens, this is for you to conquer, but if you’ll have me, I’d like to offer some words of encouragement.

We forgot, it seems to me, that to struggle is a fundamental condition of existence. We forgot how integral it is to life and progress. We’ve always had hardship in abundance, pain in abundance, never before the need to pursue it.

The 1988 social psychology paper[18] by Shelly E. Taylor and Jonathan D. Brown on Positive Illusions that argues, quote: “considerable research evidence suggests that overly positive self-evaluations, exaggerated perceptions of control or mastery, and unrealistic optimism are characteristic of normal human thought..” is perhaps the most cited paper in the very field of social psychology; nearly 8000 times.

Such a narrative sits well with our current sentiments. Its why people flock in droves to buy a copy of “The Secret” or why strategies such as “fake it ‘till you make it” are glorified so often. Now, I’m no expert, but my job here is simple: proposing an idea. And in such a fashion, I too reserve the right to scrutinize intellectual irregularities and popular falsehoods. I ask, what value is there in saying the world is so fearful and depressing that you best not look at it rationally and objectively? And to what degree should you lie to yourself—just enough?! But no more?! And for what purpose, toward what end could you possibly justify weaving these delusions? positive emotion? What value is in that in and of itself? Do the people that you look up to, the people you consider mentally healthy, delude themselves regularly?

It is my opinion that it’s wonderful that this struggle exists, that this gives life meaning. I think that we’ve unreasonably begun to expect struggle not to exist anymore, to assume our own progress. Can we not find in struggle the very essence of life? Even in comedy, do we not rejoice when being presented with the unexpected and overcoming it? Do we not find humor is the silly problems of others that lack grave consequence, or poking fun at the most basic flaws of our tendencies, even going as far as to make jokes of horrific events?

So I’ll close with words wiser than my own, of Kierkegaard, the 19th century existential philosopher who brilliantly argues this point: “There remains only one possible danger, namely, that the ease becomes so great, that it becomes altogether too great; then there is only one want left, though it is not yet a felt want, when people will want difficulty.”[19]

 

 

Thank you for listening.
