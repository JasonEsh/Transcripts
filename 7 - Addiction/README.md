# [#7 – Addiction](http://www.comfortwar.com/7-addiction/)


Hi, I’d like to present an idea:

“For an addict, it’s not unreasonable to take radical steps toward self-betterment.”                   

 

Suppose you considered yourself addicted to supernormal stimulus. You’d notice of course, that its presence was pervasive and all around you—almost like you were an alcoholic working at a bar. Except, that in this case—the case of supernormal stimuli—you’re not afforded ultimate control over your sensory intake. Good luck trying to block out sights, sounds, smells or otherwise; especially those focus-grouped and continuously engineered to better hijack your attention.

This reality, rather, of addiction to comfort, is more like trying to quit voluntary alcoholic consumption, while being subjected to forced-down hourly shots of vodka.

 

 

Here, I will examine the Comfort War through the lens of addiction; providing a rough outline of the scientific phenomena that I often refer to as being “consumed by passion”. The Comfort Warrior finds his/herself distraught, feeling that they lack the faintest sense of motivation within a life saturated by meaninglessness—and yet that could not be further from the truth. A roaring ambition resides deep within them. It is only that they’ve been overcome by its constant obsessive intensity; that they’ve suffocated it under layers of comfortable indulgence. Consumed by their own passion, prone to bouts of despair and frustration, they are for brief moments, vividly aware that they are not themselves—they are not the way they should be. Only by leaving themselves ungratified by cheap stimuli, does it surface their awareness in a booming riotous salvo of self-discovery, self-discipline, and the pursuit of clarity.

 

 

Let start by examining dopamine and endorphins. To briefly describe the function of these brain chemicals, we’ll take a look at two studies conducted on mice.

In the first[1], researchers genetically knocked out their dopamine receptors, and the mice would not eat food that was placed right in front of them—and would starve to death. However, they would enjoy, chew and swallow food that was placed in their mouths directly.

In the second[2], researchers knocked out the endorphin receptors of infant mice, and when separated from their mother, they would not cry out to her—despite this behavior constituting a death sentence in the wild[3].

Dopamine is a stimulant that incentives us to pursue and to seek, endorphins are indigenous morphine-like substances that make possible the experience of love—literally passion—while also acting as a natural pain-killer and inducing a sense of oblivion.

 

In gratifying our senses, adapting them to increasing levels of stimulation, we desensitize the same mechanism that drives us forward. In experiencing trauma, loneliness, or any other form of psychological pathology we pine for replacing this cardinal sense of inattention, of escaping ourselves, of comfort. Keith Richards, the (The) Rolling Stones’ guitarist, said of his heroin-dependence: “the contortions that we go through, just not to be ourselves for a few hours”[4].

 

And yet, despite this result, your dopaminergic neuro-adaptation can be remediated by leaving it unstimulated. Just like if you were to get used to a strong smell, or bright light, but given enough time without it, reset back to normalcy. This has been aptly demonstrated by the research of Drs. Douglas J. Lisle and Alan Goldhamer, authors of the book The Pleasure Trap[5], who took patients accustomed to junk food, and returned them to a state of finding nutritious, healthy foods to be delicious.

And in regards to psychological pathology—of course, you should seek to amend any circumstance in your life entailing unnecessary suffering. Still, the Comfort War is as much about discovering your paradise, as it is about being capable of living without it. Even our most basic, instinctual needs can be overcome by conscious observation and pursuing clarity. Take solitude, as an example; denying of our basic need for companionship is considered the worst punishment even for those living among sociopaths in prison, but was still voluntarily elected for decades at a time and overcome by many seekers of enlightenment throughout history[6].

 

The brain is plastic; through experience, it configures neurological pathways in accordance with incoming sensory data. This neuroplasticity is a remarkable phenomenon that allows us to exhibit profound versatility, but likewise is the cause of our most stubborn habits and disorders[7].

And in recent years, an abnormality has surfaced that precisely illustrates this effect as it relates supernormal stimuli—and from which we can draw some fascinating conclusions. I present to you the case study of the PIED phenomena—porn induced erectile dysfunction.

 

See, pornography-induced ED, is nothing like regular ED. It effects primarily young people, not old, and in fact, is most commonplace among those who are very sexually active when alone—not hindered in this respect by any physiological problem[8].

What has happened to them, is that the protein that modifies (through neuroplasticity) the way in which the pathways between brain areas interact as they relate to reward and addiction, called DeltaFosB (ΔFosB), has adapted their brains to react sexually to the sensory input of pornography, as opposed to regular partners.

ΔFosB is encoded in humans by the FOSB gene, and research suggests that it is induced into the brain’s reward center via stimulants such as dopamine[9]. What this means, is that activities that produce dopamine in your brain, cause this protein to be created—thereby inducing your brain to make the connection between the cues of your experience and the sensation of pleasure. It’ll seek out those cues in the future, and so the brains of those suffering of PIED has created a neuro-highway for the cues of pornographic experience (such as being seated, watching a screen, being alone, voyeurism, smells, sounds et cetera) to induce a dopaminergic response, while neglecting the usual mechanism of arousal by sexual intimacy with a real partner.

 

Sure enough, to overcome pornography-induced ED, participants go through a “reboot” period, leaving themselves ungratified by porn, while forming connections with real partners in a normalized environment. However, while this process used to be attested online as to taking an average of 2-6 weeks before complete recovery—yet recent testimonials by those exposed to pornography at a younger age and at greater saturation, have reported reboot periods of up to 12 or even 24 months before full recovery[10].

This seems to me the canary in the coal mine. Supernormal stimuli is far from having had its final say.

 

 

In order to successfully cure themselves of their addiction, men and women often go so far as to subject themselves to a “higher power that can restore sanity” (as stated in the original version of the 12 step-program[11]). For an addict, it’s not unreasonable to take radical steps toward self-betterment. There’s nothing irrational about it, up against the most fundamental aspects of your nature and nurture, enlisted in a fight you’ve been losing your entire life—prioritizing the pursuit of mental health, of clarity, is what’s demanded of you.

You’ve been consumed by your own passion. Define your daily success and failure by the conduct of an MR. Don’t allow yourself to forget that you want it. In the dire depths of subconscious mindlessness, shackle yourself to a conspectus: “I want to become better”.

 

 

Thank you for listening.
