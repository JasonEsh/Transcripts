# [#3 – Mathematics of Self-Actualization](http://www.comfortwar.com/3-mathematics-self-actualization/)


Hi, I’d like to present an idea:

“Clarity can be thought of as the third derivative of a self–actualization function.”

 

Before I get any further into this idea on maths and method, I should address first an obvious flaw; Namely, that thinking humanity a concept abstract enough to qualify for the rigor demanded by the formal sciences is precisely the sort of egregious mistake that has led us in the past to conclusions such as those of Karl Pearson and his equation of inferior races[1]. It is the mistake we make when we attempt to correlate the unquantifiable with the unrelated, it’s akin to hocus-pocus of astrologists, the gobbledygook of witch-doctors, or the occasional Nobel prize awarded to an economist.[2]

Yet these unsightly follies notwithstanding, it would remiss of us to wholeheartedly ignore the considerable merit arithmetic operations can offer in other areas of our lives. The insightful words of Viktor Frankl come to mind, enriching us in his description of desperation by an equation:
“D = S – M”[3]; suffering without meaning. Or likewise, in the epic tale that gave rise to the Dark Forest theory, building upon the 2 axioms and 2 concepts of cosmic sociology.[4] In this sense such ideas are confined beyond the realm of certainty or prediction; narrowed exclusively, rather, into a line of thought—but a line nonetheless, from which one may infer a direction.

 

The individual engaged in the Comfort War is similarly confined; unable to think clearly, aware of his/herself and discontent by it but only for brief moments, consumed by their own insatiable passion, succumbing to an ever-encroaching pervasiveness of cheap comforts, spread-thin by a deafening, yet unknown challenge. He/she finds their redemption in clarity, in pursuing it—even if only for its own sake. They unleash their sense of drive and obsession by leaving it ungratified by prefabricated stimulus; by uncovering and molding their fear. They learn eventually to thrive off stress, and experience like they never have, or could ever expect before. After all, this is the crux of finding yourself in the Comfort War; the lack of clarity. And in the simple and consistent dedication to a daily reminder—lies all the potential in the world.

 

 

So, let’s go on and establish this premise—and should you accept it—the mathematical implications. First, let’s suppose an aggregated combination of all the measures an individual seeks to self-actualize, folded into a single dimension and plotted on a y-axis as it relates to time. What we have as a result is a simple motion graph; position over time.

 

This “position”, as you can imagine—your position as you relate to self-actualization—must be uniquely described. Skills, as we’re all aware, tend to have distinct limits; this is often portrayed with an S curve[5]—arching both near the upper and lower margins.

As you improve at anything, your progress is at first slow, then considerable, and finally curbed again near the boundaries of human potential. But that, of course, isn’t the end of the story—because at that lower limit, with every small improvement, you’re several multiples better than your old self, and at the very top—every bloody inch counts.

For example, ever since people have begun keeping track, a sub-4 minute mile has been broken over 6000 times by athlete runners. 3:55 has been broken roughly 1400 times. 3:50 has been broken roughly 151 times, and 3:45 has been broken 6 times by a total of 3 men[6]. One could argue whether or not a 3:40 mile is even possible, but what is undeniable is that the closer we’ve gotten to such a potential limit, the considerably fewer the participants. We see this in every sport, we see it in financial competition; beat out 90{0a0b83f9b6cb67b151ba1e8e0031e7bf840b8ccfe44d681543c87b6fb2907cf8} of the planet and you’re left with a net worth of about US$85 thousand, but go just 9.99999{0a0b83f9b6cb67b151ba1e8e0031e7bf840b8ccfe44d681543c87b6fb2907cf8} further and you’re worth about US$1.5 billion[7].

As we approach the frontier, each step becomes more challenging by several measures, like a mass attempting to approach light-speed. Yet the value of each of those minute advancements is conversely significant; each miniscule heading—increasingly worthwhile.

So this curvature at the limits is eclipsed when judging your self-actualized position in “real terms” sort-of-speak; the value as it is inherently to us—subjective. Our limits for this premise therefore are but infinity and its negative counterpart; the seven heavens and the depths of hell.

 

That means we’ve roughly defined f(x); our self-actualization function. A position, measured as a cumulative skill of sorts, how you are relative to how you wish to be as you move through time. Let’s move on to the next step then, and define it’s first derivative; a velocity—the rate of change in this skill. For this, imagine an idea I would describe as “practical exertion/effort”—the degree to which you’re able move practically and increase your ability at any given time (or vice versa, the degree to which you’re unable as your ability declines). You can imagine, then, that “practical exertion” is critical to successful progression. And it is how we go about things usually, exploring the best methods to achieve our goals and implementing them.

Next, let’s derive that; we have an acceleration—our second derivative. You can imagine for this again, perhaps a concept such as “implacable discipline” or “new-found inspiration”. It is not necessarily readily available at all times, but you’re able to call on it every so often, and increase in those moments your efforts past the baseline you’ve previously established. Or vice versa, in its decrepit lacking it can gnaw at your output, decreasing your rate of gain, dragging it into the negative abyss of deterioration.

Finally, let’s derive it all once more; we have our third third derivative of position—jerk; a devil indeed. You don’t often hear of the third derivative, though it does happen of occasion; the rate of change of g-force for example. Why, even Nixon, the evil bastard, campaigned on the third derivative to advance his case for a second term, announcing that the rate of increase of inflation was decreasing[8].

And what acts, you might ask, as the primer for ferocious discipline, as the instigator of vicious inspiration, as the dictator of congruent, fervent motivation? What, in so far as personal progress pertains to actualizing one’s self can in such subtle consistency drive a maddening pace? Clarity, of course.

Clarity in self-discovery and unleashing the will to act on what’s been discovered. Clarity in directing your efforts clearly, built upon a stable foundation of regular attention, pursued precisely because it counteracts it’s equally devastating counterpart lying at the opposing polar end; those of comfort, the third derivative of deterioration.

 

That’s our premise; position, velocity, acceleration and jerk. Consider the implications.

First, understand the enemy you face, its essence well-define by this criterion. Supernormal stimuli, or comfort as I usually refer to it, acts insidiously, unnoticed, weighing upon and tipping the scales further ever so slightly. It degrades us in the only way we would ever allow, in a subtlety undetected, the slowly boiling water encompassing the unsuspecting frog.

Comfort by its very nature has relentlessly encroached upon you since birth in this inconspicuous manner. You fail to recognize it as the root cause, noting only the symptoms of the higher derivatives; looking to get healthy, rich, win friends, and influence people, stupefied by an inability to consciously maintain momentum—riding the waves of ambition only to crash upon the shores of failure.

That is the nuance of the third derivative.

The influence of comfort could not be more efficient or better targeted, at it impairs precisely the faculties needed to detect it; your attentive perception. In this manner, its grasp continuously works to impede and exceed your reach; the deeper you’re in its hold, the less capable you are of recognizing it. And as if that is not enough, there’s more. Because even should you become briefly aware of it, as you do during rare outbursts of frustrated desperation, comfort awaits you with one final snare. It self-perpetuates and self-enforces by instilling strong aversions specifically toward the countermeasures needed to extract yourself out of such a state. Despising hardship and long calm bouts of reflective thought, you’re enforced into a positive-feedback loop of deterioration.

 

Second, therein lies the absolute method to counteract its effect and overcome this trial; the perfect weapon in your arsenal—clarity. Self-pursuit, giving rise to you attention and desperate, frustration obsession, is the definitively antithetical conspectus to which you can shackle your prioritization; reliable in needing nothing else but this daily commitment, subtle and simple enough an idea to hold onto in your darkest hours. Qualifying, in and of itself as a guarantor of eventual soaring self-actualized progress—even only in so far as decelerating your regressions long before you reach a point of actual progress.

This is the potential of the third derivative.

The pursuit of clarity is, and always will be, the primary struggle of the Comfort Warrior.

 

 

And how does this all look mathematically? How does this, in practice, apply both to the individual and to society at large?

I would say, if you were to graph it for an individual currently traversing the gates of hell (and not showing any signs of slowing down), 4 distinct stages emerge:

1st, we have a deceleration in absolute terms; the consistent pursuit of clarity increases a negatively valued acceleration. The individual is still picking up speed in the wrong direction, still entrenched in supernormal stimuli and poor habits, but at a lesser pace, no longer fundamentally surging toward it.

I call this first stage “rehabilitation”.

2nd, we reach an eventual point where acceleration is zeroes and then reverses positively. Still, we are headed at full force downward, but our absolute velocity has peaked, now slowing its rate, soon to hit a valley. At this point the individual can well-notice the benefits of the MR and conversely—the influences of comfort, they’re well-aware of their disgust for it, and are regularly able to leverage his/her desperation to extract themselves out of it. But they are still entrenched in their environment, hammered down by too many factors with too great a pull; demanding of them to a maddening effect, that still they reset daily. That they see the light, go blind, and be asked to dare expose themselves to sharp momentarily-painful brightness once-more.

I call this second stage “chaos”.

3rd, now velocity has been zeroed out as well and in the meanwhile, acceleration has had a grand ol’ time picking up its pace. This moment is brief, I would say, at least for you to contend with existentially; now you’re within a congruent environment or at a point no longer affected by comfort and the imperative to control for its damage. I’ll admit that I do not tell of this stage by experience, but by conjecture.

I call this third stage “focus”.

Then, hurriedly, comes in the 4th stage, with a positive velocity rapidly increasing and accompanied too by a rising acceleration. Remember, we’ve define this as a position in subjective, personal value terms, and straightened out the curvature at the edges. I call this fourth stage “enlightenment”, and at that point who knows what the fuck happens.

The overall mindset for this, making progress by a derivative’s derivative’s derivative is one where you fundamentally commit yourself to the pursuit of clarity above all else. This is not a path possible for those who seek to advance by maintaining vision of a finish line. It demands great humility and a willing gratitude. It demands that you stop needing to be recognized as “special” or “great” for you to see your life as worthwhile. It demands that besides the occurring results, you find contentment in the effort alone, especially in failure, with all that you’ve got, for as long as you have. It’s a recklessness truly exclusive to the desperate.

 

 

And, what of the grander scale? What we’re dealing with here, this idea, is it a unified theory?

What of a society, exponentially expanding, when suddenly confronted with a challenge the vast majority of its members will never overcome? What of a conscious species confronted with supernormal stimuli? What do I predict in an unpredictable world using a non-predicting theorem?

Well, I’d imagine, that at first, it decelerates; comfort, the third derivative at negative value draws in with its subtle and relentless pull. People are affected by it; lower attention spans, a subdued willingness to dissent. Maybe overall, Moore’s law begins to slow[9], flying cars and self-lacing shoes don’t quite arrive as fast as we may have expected. No matter, eh? Still powering forward at an increasing rate.

But eventually, acceleration zeros and reverses; employing its pull of velocity, on blatant progress that has reached a maximum rate, and begins itself to slow, just barely at first. Here maybe, supernormal stimuli is perfectly streamlined; think of the mood organ, in Phillip K. Dick’s “Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep”[10]. Then what? Well, velocity zeroes, reverses, and we drop off a cliff. It goes both ways. We’re too far in its claws by then, too late to do anything about it. Perhaps permanently.

 

Not an antibiotic-resistant superbug, not AI, not a zombie apocalypse, and probably not a nuclear one. Not global warming, not even over-population, but subtle, long-gone unnoticed, grand deterioration.

The time to act is now, that is the conclusion we’ll reach once it’s too late and we’re looked back. In our day-and-age, still, we do have choice. Sort yourself out, Warrior, a great challenge lies ahead.

 

 

 

Thank you for listening.
